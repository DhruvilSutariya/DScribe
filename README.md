# DScribe
Notebook for things that I can document well.

This is just side activity for me that I wanted to do very long time. Which is to write (short summaries) about things that I am interested in learning. If I fill the content I gather over some time is some what meaningful I will create a site (like on `github.io`) for more interesting UI.

Things that I will learn / write about:
- Elements of a programming language
  - Like types, composite types in programming language
  - Program flows (Loops / Branches / Routines)
  - Some internals like memory allocations, garbage collections
- Designing a system (Low level design)
  -  Elements to consider while designing a class / behavior etc.
  -  Some practical implementations, comparing two alternate solutions
  -  How a performance can be improved by just designing it in a different way etc.
- Other components in a real world
  - It's not just programs that we write in a computer are important, There are stuffs as well like
    - Networking, Scheduling, Permanent storages (Databases) etc.
- Competitve programming
  - Algorithms and some really cool data structures.
  - Although 90% real world challenges are searching-sorting, there can be some elements of complex data structure that can be used in real world system.
 
PS: I just find the name DScribe really cool, as it contains my initial and the motive behind this repo.
